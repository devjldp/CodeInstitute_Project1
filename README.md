# Deployment
The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps taken to deploy are as follows:

* Log in to [Github](https://github.com/)  
* Navigate to [devjldp/CodeInstitute_Project1](https://github.com/devjldp/CodeInstitute_Project1) in the list of repositories.  
* In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.  
* In Settings scroll down to GitHub pages which opens in a new page.
* From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
* Once the master branch has been selected, the page is automatically refreshed and a display indicates the successful deployment and the link to the address.
* The link to the live website is here: [Wedding: Wishes and Dreams](https://devjldp.github.io/CodeInstitute_Project1/)

# Bugs
* The button that displays the menu on mobile size shows the menu, but it doesn't respond. The bug, which was caused by adding unnecessary Bootstrap scripts, has been fixed.  
* The menu displayed on mobile size appeared centered without alignment, displaying an untidy appearance. It has been fixed by aligning the text to the left.  
W* hen we are on the services page, the link is not displayed as active. The error was that the "active" class was missing.
* It is presumed that Chrome developer tools is in general not as accurate as the physical devices. In several cases what was displayed on the responsiveness testing in Chrome development tools was not exactly as appeared on actual devices so changes were always checked on actual devices for final approval.
